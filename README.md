# Drug-Venture Companion

A new Flutter application to make drugs safe to use and prevent overdose.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Inspiration
The workshop by Alannah Fricker really got us thinking about a way to make a safer environment for people doing recreational drugs. This app currently only focuses on opioid users but are highly scalable to cater to diverse users due to the technology stack chosen. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in social distancing. This prevents people from using while with someone they trust. The isolation has also led to people using more, which changes the body’s tolerance to various substances. What is needed is a way for people to ensure they’re looked after, even when they have to be alone.

## What it does
The main purpose of this app is to make it safer for recreational drugs to be used alone. We wanted it to be like a friend at a party checking up on someone. This app does 3 main things. First, it presents a checklist of helpful things to do before starting your adventure. These would include, unlocking the door, getting out the Naloxone etc. Second, when the "adventure" button is triggered, a virtual assistant voice bot checks on the user occasionally to make sure they are in stable conditions. Third, it phones a friend on the emergency contact list to call for help if the person is imperil. This app has the potential to save lives by assisting in the prevention of and response to opioid overdoses

## How we built it
The main app was built using android studio. To get the tech demos working in such little time, we used the code examples. We used figma to design the prototype and Flutter to get the Frontend setup. Used discord, google docs, and google slides to communicate and organize the project.

## Challenges we ran into
Getting the APIs to work took most of saturday. It is our first time using flutter, so there are many features that are not yet implemented. Getting an app to work in that short time is hard.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Thinking up a simple solution to a major problem. And this app has the ability to add more features to determine if the user is overdosing. Despite the challenges, we polled our energy into creating a front-end showcasing the main features and conveying our group ideas .

## What we learned
How to use google cloud APIs to synthesize speech, and natural language processing. How to make an app using Firebase. Learnt about developing using Flutter.

## What's next for digital drug adventure companion
The next steps for the app would be to scale it by adding additional features such as: Monitoring heart rate and blood oxygen levels using a connection with smart watches. Monitor for skin turning blue from lack of oxygen using the camera on the phone. Monitor for labored breathing using the mic on the phone. Have a list of safe injection sites and their operation hours. Add a log of the user's dosages and frequency of use to track decreasing tolerances.
